        "*   **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Initial data loading revealed issues with column names (e.g., `KeyError: 'Units Sold'`) and 'Date' column parsing (`DateParseError`). These were resolved by stripping whitespace from all column names and handling unparseable dates by converting them to `NaT` and then dropping the corresponding rows. Missing 'Region' values were filled with 'Unknown'.\n",
        "*   **Revenue and Rank Calculation:** The 'Revenue' column was successfully calculated by multiplying 'Price/unit' and 'Units Sold', and a 'Rank' column was added based on the descending order of 'Revenue'.\n",

        "*   **Top Performing Stores:** 'Arochukwu' emerged as the highest-grossing store with a total revenue of \\$81,842,511, followed by 'Aba North' (\\$42,088,690) and 'Bende' (\\$38,646,304). The analysis identified only 6 unique stores in the dataset for the top stores calculation.\n",
        "*   **Top Performing Lines of Business (LOB):** 'Service Plan' significantly led in revenue with \\$178,446,194, far surpassing 'Parts' (\\$26,411,008) and 'Copier Sale' (\\$21,600,480). Only 4 unique LOBs were present in the dataset for the top LOBs calculation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The substantial revenue generated by 'Service Plan' suggests it is a core business driver and warrants further investigation into its success factors to replicate across other LOBs or regions.\n",
        "*   The significant disparity in revenue among stores (e.g., Arochukwu vs. other stores) indicates potential for targeted strategies; further analysis could explore factors contributing to the top-performing stores' success or identify underperforming stores that require intervention.\n"
